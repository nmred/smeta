* Sharing symbols 101

	pthreads ensures the read and resulting variable is safe, it is still down to the user to use synchronization to tell when a variable is going to be available in another context
	it is inefficient to keep reading a variable until it exists as you might with normal objects in php, this is because reading and writing object data in pthreads results in locking
